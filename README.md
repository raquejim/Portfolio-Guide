# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| ✈️ [Airplane Ticket Reservation System](https://github.com/tinakralimarkova1/Airline_Ticket_Reservation_System) | Data analysis, data transformation | Web application built with Flask and MySQL for managing airline ticket reservations. Created as a course project for Databases (CSCI-SHU 213) at NYU Shanghai, the system demonstrates relational database design, backend data handling, SQL joins and aggregates, and role-based access control. |

# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 📲 ["GuideMe" Capstone Project](https://github.com/tinakralimarkova1/GuideMe) | Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing | Android application designed to help elderly adults and first-time smartphone users learn essential mobile skills through guided, interactive simulations. Within the app there's voice and text search, where users can get recommended lessons based on their query. This feature was developed by training a convolutional network that was then transferred to Android Studio through TensorFlow Lite. | pandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib |

# Tableau

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| 📈 [Maven Unicorn Challenge](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Maven-Unicorn-Challenge) | Cleansed and transformed data on privately-owned companies (start-ups) valued at over $1 billion using Python. Visualised key insights using Tableau, including the timeline of valuations, the top 10 countries and investors with the highest valuations, the most successful unicorns, and the average time it takes to reach a $1 billion valuation. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katie.huang/viz/UnicornCompanies_16502745371460/Unicorns?publish=yes) |

# Google Earth Engine

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🚗 [Uber Taxi](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Uber%20Project) | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
